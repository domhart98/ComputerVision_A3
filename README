Jupyter notebook provided in COMP425(Computer Vision), to fill out for assignment 2. 

Skeleton code opened in Google Colab, and saved directly to Github. Therefore, notebook can
be opened directly from public repository, user does not have to mind setup.

Colab provides access to Google hardware, GPU's in this case, via cloud. These additional
resources vastly speed up operations on large datasets, as is the case with machine learning 
algorithms
